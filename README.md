## talbii.github.io

My Github-hosted website. Nothing too special, in the future I might add some articles I've written here.

For now, this website doesn't feature many things, and uses plain CSS, but for now I'm happy with the results.

For any inquiries, you can contact me [here](https://talbii.github.io/pages/contact.html).

**Note: This website is moving to a new URL: [tal.bi](https://tal.bi).**

**Checkout the repository for it [here](https://github.com/talbii/tal.bi)**
